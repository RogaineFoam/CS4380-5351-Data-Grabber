-- A simple tool that collects all the runtimes from the output in our parallel class
-- FORMAT OF RUNTIMES MUST BE LIKE: "compute time: [TIME] s" it'll be this way if you havent modified what Burtscher did
-- USAGE: python getdata.py [input file] [items per column]
-- The sample output was generated by running "python getdata.py sample_input 17". Output is a basic CSV file
